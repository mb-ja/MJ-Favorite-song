            <h3> [Verse 1]</h3>
                <p> I don't make the rules </p>
<p> I'm just here facin' my all fuckin' fears in the name of you</p>
<p> Engineered to sit back and watch you steer for a game or two </p>   
<br>
<h3> [Pre-Chorus] </h3>
<p> Do my best to let you know where it's all at</p>
<p> Act like I don't know you're lyin' 'cause you like that</p>
<p>Make a scene and fuckin' leave just to come right back </p>
<br>
<h3> [Chorus] </h3>
<p> How you do it? How you do it? Keep me sidetracked </p>
<p> How you do it? How you do it? Keep me sidetracked </p>
<p> How you do it? How you do it? (Do it) </p>
<h3> [Verse 2]</h3>
<p> It's time to face it </p>
